# STRM Privacy front-end engineering take home

This is the repo for the take-home assignment for [front-end engineering roles at STRM](https://join.strm.team).

## Background 

If you're interviewing at [STRM Privacy](https://strmprivacy.io), you have received the assignment separately. This is just the prepared project to get you started quickly.

## Goal 
The goal of this exercise is to see how you solve problems and assess general skills relevant to the role of front-end engineer. It is not a "do algo X" coding interview or rigged to make you trip and stumble. This should be a fun exercise with real-world validity for the work you will be doing at STRM.  

This repo and your edits to it serve as the “base layer” of the assignment, but the most important part is the discussion you will have with our team. 

In discussing, we’ll focus on three main areas:

- Problem solving (why did you choose a specific solution?)
- Prioritization and Scoping (how did you approach the assignment?)
- Understanding of and general engineering skills (e.g. structuring code).
- OK, four areas: your questions. 

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install -i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
